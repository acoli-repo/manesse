## Content

- [`pdf/`](pdf) transcription data, PDF export. (This is for human consultation.)
- [`xml/`](xml) transcription data, Transkribus Page XML format ("Page XML"), also includes source images. (This is for subsequent processing/technically interested colleagues.)
- [`tei/`](tei) generated from `xml/` using `make tei`
	- Note: The Transkribus TEI export contains XML-valid image information, bounding boxes, transliteration and annotations -- but it does not provide TEI compliant data structures for project-specific annotations. The post-processing of these annotations is addressed in the next project phase.
	- Note: Transkribus TEI provides visual information first (under `/TEI/facsimile`), then followed by text and annotations (under `/TEI/text`), connected by XPointers. For manually inspecting the validity of annotations and transliteration, please **scroll down** to the first `<text>` element.

## How to (re)build  `tei/` from scratch (for developers)

- requirements
	- Unix-style command-line with `bash`, `make`, `wget`, `git` (tested under Ubuntu 22.04L)
	- Note: `make update_tei` will install [SaxonJ-HE 12.5](https://github.com/Saxonica/Saxon-HE/releases/download/SaxonHE12-5/SaxonHE12-5J.zip), see [Saxonica](https://www.saxonica.com/download/java.xml) for requirements regarding Java version, etc.
12.5 )
- deposit your XML files in [`xml/`](xml)
- run `make update_tei` for an incremental update (transform only files for which target TEI does not exist yet)
	- run `make tei` will only generate new TEI files if the target directory (`tei/`) does not exist yet
	- to build all from scratch, delete the `tei/` folder and run `make tei` (or `make update_tei`)
- if all goes well, find your output in [`tei/`](tei)
- if not, check the logs ;)
